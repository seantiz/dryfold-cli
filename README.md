# What is the Dryfold CLI?

A tool to reinforce my C++ and Rust know-how, first and foremost!

But beyond that, Dryfold helps with:

1. Static code analysis
2. Complexity scores and estimated time - decide if migrating to a new language (like Rust) is worth it
3. Export to Github Projects - plan the work among the team. Everyone loves a kanban, right? I do.
4. Export to CSV if you want to view the source codebase in a dataviz app like Gephi.
5. Export to JSON for other project management/kanban board apps like Kanri.
6. Export to TSV, SVG and .dot.

## Install Github's gh Before Creating Github Projects

If you want to publish a new Github project from your Dryfold maps, you'll need to have `gh` CLI tool installed locally so you can post to your Github profile. Your `gh` will also need permission to create and edit projects on your Github account.

Github has its own code verification process for doing this from the `gh` tool itself.

# Example: Dryfold Put to Use

A brief visual plan when you load the CSV data from Dryfold into an app like Gephi:
